# Changes

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 source candidate

This is unpublished source. Cargo publication remains disabled.

- Correct media-range parameter specificity and parameters on either side of `q`.
- Correct weighted language lookup and wildcard defaults; validate concrete server tags with an
  existing language-tag parser.
- Cache complete choices for shared offer sets within one immutable head and limits.
- Own borrowed configuration in named raw path/header/query matcher types; add `SyncSelector` while
  preserving local-only custom matchers in `Selector`.
- Reject duplicate capture names within one compiled path at construction.
- Share service tables when cloning routers, with copy-on-write when editing a shared clone.
- Separate ordinary `DispatchError<E>` from request-preserving misses. `error_on_miss()` now returns
  `RequestRouter` with `RequestDispatchError<B, E>` and supports non-default response bodies.
- Add a real Axum HTTP/1.1 hosting example with error mapping, trusted cleartext context, HEAD/405
  preservation, and outer Vary policy.

Breaking alpha API changes: `Head` is cloneable rather than `Copy`; language matching and limits
use Warded-owned types; string-taking helper return types are named; no-match errors and their
adapter are separate from ordinary dispatch errors. Strict ordered error propagation is retained.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

Initial unpublished source alpha: ordered complete-predicate selection, isolated captures,
body-free matching, raw path/header/query helpers, optional negotiation and Tower dispatch,
selected-only readiness, and explicit fallback/no-match policies.
